# statistics
a set of statistical functions (Bernoulli distribution table, expected value and variance, sample mean, sample median and sample variance
## Bernoulli distribution table
This program includes functions determining the Bernoulli distribution table for
a certain number of trials and the probability of success in a single trial. 
Plus checking and comparing the speed of selected functions.
## Expected value and variance
The program includes functions determining the expected value and variance for the distribution
Bernoulli.
- based on the table of probabilities
- based on the knowledge of the parameters n and p.
Plus checking and comparing the speed of selected functions.
## Sample mean, sample median and sample variance
This program includes functions determining sample mean, sample median and sample variance.
Plus checking and comparing the speed of selected functions
